# FLOW-020 — Each E2E suite writes its own "open a management page" helper (DEBT-026)

- Kind: effort
- Observed: opening the management dialog and clicking a card is written again in
  `e2e/patient-duplicate/`, `e2e/bank-statement-label/`, `e2e/patient/`, `e2e/fund/` and
  `e2e/bank-account/`.
- Proposal: one helper in `e2e/helpers/` replaces the copies.
- Costs: one small pull request. Protects: a change of the dialog breaking five suites
  in five ways.
- Decision (owner, 2026-10-04): one shared helper in `e2e/helpers/`, used by the five suites.
