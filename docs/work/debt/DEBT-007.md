# 2026-07-30 — DEBT-007 — Explicit unassign does not survive a later link-fund cascade

**Found by:** post-v0.20.0 audit (spec-checker, BAS-062).

**Where:** `src-tauri/src/use_cases/bank_statement_reconciliation/reconciliation.rs` — `apply_link_fund` re-runs `auto_match` unconditionally; a deliberately unassigned line (`assigned_group_ids` empty) matches the auto-match eligibility filter and gets silently re-matched, contradicting BAS-062's "takes precedence for the rest of the recompute".

**Observation:** fixing it needs an explicit-override marker on the working line (design call on the engine's state model) for an interaction that requires unassigning then linking a different label in the same session — rare. Defer until the engine is next touched.
