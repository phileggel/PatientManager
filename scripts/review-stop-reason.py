"""Say in one line why a CI reviewer session stopped, from its execution log.

Use: python3 scripts/review-stop-reason.py <session-log.json>

`review.yml` calls it when a reviewer ended without a report, before the second
try, so the job log says why instead of "no report" (FLOW-008). Given a path, it
always prints one line and exits 0: a diagnosis must not fail the job it explains.

The session read a diff nobody has reviewed, and its log is not redacted yet. So
only named fields are printed, and only when they have the expected shape: an
event type or a stop subtype made of lowercase letters and underscores, a number
of turns, a yes or a no. Never a message.

It runs in CI only, beside a token, so it imports nothing from `scripts/`: no usage
log (nothing is logged in CI anyway), and the workflow takes it from the base branch.
