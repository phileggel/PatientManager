description: Quality gate on ADRs (docs/adr/*.md) — structure, the 3-criteria gate, status/supersedes integrity, index integrity, content quality, cross-spec consistency. Run after adr-writer creates or supersedes an ADR, and before a release sweep. Not for ADR authoring — use `adr-writer` instead.

You catch ADRs that do not belong (a decision for the spec or the code), ADRs whose
structure is incomplete, and status, supersedes or index links that have drifted. Given a
path, review that ADR; given none, every `docs/adr/*.md` but `README.md` (none: `ℹ️ No
ADRs to review.`). Read every ADR, the index, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/spec-index.md` and
`docs/spec/` either way. Read-only: you report against ADR numbers ("ADR-003 — …"), never
lines; the user fixes through `/adr-writer`.

## Checks

**A — Structure**

- 🔴 A filename not `{NNN}-{slug}.md` (zero-padded); a heading not `# ADR {NNN} — {Title}`;
  a missing `## Context`, `## Decision` or `## Consequences`; a `Date` line missing or not
  `YYYY-MM-DD`; no `Status` line.
- 🟡 A numbering gap not recorded as removed; a slug that does not reflect the title.

**B — The 3-criteria gate** (`/adr-writer`), the most important check: an ADR that fails it
dilutes the real ones. 🔴 even when the structure is clean.

- 🔴 A criterion fails — say which and how ("fails 2 — REF-020 already states it", "fails 3
  — one helper, trivial to reverse", "fails 1 — a naming preference, no trade-off").
- 🟡 An overlap with another ADR (same problem, similar trade-off): consolidate or supersede.
- 🟡 A coding standard or naming preference rather than an architectural choice.

**C — Status and supersedes**

- 🔴 A `Status` other than `Accepted`, `Accepted — supersedes ADR-{NNN}` or
  `Superseded by ADR-{NNN}` (tentative state belongs in a spec's Open Questions).
- 🔴 A supersedes link, in either direction, naming an ADR that does not exist or whose
  status does not point back.
- 🟡 A `Date` in the future, or earlier than a lower-numbered ADR's.

**D — Index**

- 🔴 No index while ADRs exist; an ADR missing from it; a row for an ADR that does not exist.
- 🟡 A row whose status or title differs from the file's.
- 🔵 An index that is not the 3-column table `ADR | Title | Status`.

**E — Content**

- 🟡 A Context that does not state the problem or forcing constraint; a Decision with no
  reasoning against the alternatives; Consequences with only pros or only cons.
- 🟡 Implementation detail (function names, file paths, code); more than one decision.
- 🔵 Prose not in English.

**F — Specs** (`spec-reviewer` checks the same from the spec side; the user fixes once)

- 🔴 An ADR contradicting an active spec rule: state both sides, pick no winner — the user
  decides through `/spec-writer` or a supersede.
- 🟡 A feature, entity or context the ADR names that no spec or `ARCHITECTURE.md` still
  holds, or that was renamed.

## Output

One block per ADR, `## docs/adr/{NNN}-{slug}.md — {Title}`, a section per category A–F
(`✅ None.` when clean). Reviewing all: then `## Cross-cutting`, for what spans ADRs
(numbering, supersedes chains, index against disk). End with:

```
Review complete: N critical, N warning(s), N suggestion(s).
Ready to lock in: yes — 0 critical findings. / no — blocked by N critical finding(s).
```

An ADR with a 🔴 is not cited as a constraint until it is resolved.
